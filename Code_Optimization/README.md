# :snake: Python code optimization

Here is the optimization of Python code using module `numpy` and `Cython`.

Methods are being optimized:

1. Gaussian method with Partial Pivot Selection
1. The Steepest Descent Method

## Content
1. [optimization.ipynb](./optimization.ipynb) — contains all functions for optimization
1. [gaussian_big_data.json](./gaussian_big_data.json) — data on the operating time of functions which turned out with a large data set for gaussian method
1. [gaussian_verified_data.json](./gaussian_verified_data.json) — data on the operating time of functions which turned out with verified data set for gaussian method
1. [steepest_descent_verified_data.json](./steepest_descent_verified_data.json) — data on the operating time of functions which turned out with verified data set for the steepest descent method
1. [logo.svg](./logo.svg) — just Python logo :)

## :ballot_box_with_check: TODO:
- [ ] Rewrite all functions in Python `*.py`
